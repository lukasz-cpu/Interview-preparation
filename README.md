1. Fibonacci Sequence


```java
public class Fibonacci {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // number of terms in the sequence
        int a = 0, b = 1, c;

        System.out.print("Fibonacci sequence of " + n + " terms: ");

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            System.out.print(a + " ");
            c = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
    }
}
```

2. Generation of prime numbers

```java
public class PrimeNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        for(int i = 2; i < 100; i++){

            if(isPrime(i)){
                System.out.println(i);
            }
        }
    }

    static boolean isPrime(int number) {
        boolean isPrime = true;

        for (int i = 2; i < number; i++){
            if (number % i == 0) {
                isPrime = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        return isPrime;
    }
}
```

4. Authentication vs. Authorization

- Authentication (AuthN) is a process that verifies that someone or something is who they say they are. Technology systems typically use some form of authentication to secure access to an application or its data. For example, when you need to access an online site or service, you usually have to enter your username and password. Then, behind the scenes, it compares the username and password you entered with a record it has on its database. If the information you submitted matches, the system assumes you are a valid user and grants you access. System authentication in this example presumes that only you would know the correct username and password. It, therefore, authenticates you by using the principle of something only you would know.

- Authorization is the security process that determines a user or service's level of access. In technology, we use authorization to give users or services permission to access some data or perform a particular action. If we revisit our coffee shop example, Rahul and Lucia have different roles in the coffee shop. As Rahul is a barista, he may only place and view orders. Lucia, on the other hand, in her role as manager, may also have access to the daily sales totals. Since Rahul and Lucia have different jobs in the coffee shop, the system would use their verified identity to provide each user with individual permissions. It is vital to note the difference here between authentication and authorization. Authentication verifies the user (Lucia) before allowing them access, and authorization determines what they can do once the system has granted them access (view sales information).
